I speak fluent English (TOEIC 980) and Iâ€™m currently learning German. Therefore I would like to propose that we meet in order to convince you of my motivation and I am already enclosing my CV to that effect. I look forward to your reply and thank you in advance for your time and attention. I remain available for any information."
